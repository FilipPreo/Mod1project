# King County (Seattle) housing data analysis

This project's goal was to build a simple, multivariate linear regression model for predicting the sale price of houses within King County. The final model we built predicted the natural log of the price based on the area of living space (sq. feet) and the distance from the highest priced property per area in the dataset.
